Fantactic
==========

The idea of this game came after seeing a kid blowing things off a table with his small fan.

Using the  [inverse square law] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law), you will be using the two fans to move the object around the the world to collect things.

This game uses the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) game framework.

Still unfinished work and still a long way to go, but you may get a taste of what it should be like [here](https://shockry.github.io/fantactic). Just pretend that these boxes are fans for now :D
